        <p>
          We have teamed up with Gregory &amp; Kara Rider with Rider Real Estate
          and Todd Brefeld with Nexa Mortgage. These folks are AMAZING!! If you
          buy a home from Greg and Kara, they will donate 10% of their
          commission to Pacific Northwest Family Navigation! If you finance with
          Todd, he will give you a free home appraisal worth up to $800. How
          awesome is that? Not only do you get an amazing new home but you get
          to help your favorite non-profit! Whoo-hoo! The only catch? You have
          to tell them we sent you! Check out what they have to offer below!
