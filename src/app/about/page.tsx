        Pacific Northwest Family Navigation is a non-profit organization rooted
        in advocacy, education, and resource distribution. Our story began in
        2012 with Melissa Dodge, founder of the Vancouver, Washington
        Mom&rsquo;s Autism Support group. For over a decade, this group has been
        a lifeline for families, offering support, hosting sensory-sensitive
        events, and connecting caregivers with invaluable resources.

      <p>
        Building on that foundation, Pacific Northwest Family Navigation expands
        this vital work to create a broader, more impactful community hub. We
        are dedicated to empowering families and caregivers of children with
        developmental delays and disabilities by connecting them to resources,
        providing educational opportunities, and advocating for their needs.
      </p>

        Collaboration is at the heart of what we do. By working with local
        organizations and embracing cultural sensitivity, we strive to ensure
        every family feels welcomed and supported. Whether you&rsquo;re seeking
        resources, advocacy, or community, Pacific Northwest Family Navigation
        is here to help you navigate the journey.
